# ScholarSphere: Facilitating Research by Collecting Quality Papers

 Greetings to all Researchers and Scholars!

I am an undergraduate student working on my thesis in the field of Brain Tumour Segmentation. In my opinion, the quality of research papers you engage with significantly influences the direction of your own research. However, finding high-quality research papers can be quite a challenging task ðŸ˜©. Whether you are using Google Scholar, Springer, or other research tools, it often requires a certain level of expertise to determine whether a research paper is a valuable resource.

For novice researchers entering the field, the overwhelming number of research papers to review can be disheartening. Only a fraction of these papers are truly essential for their work. At this stage, many researchers find themselves drained of energy and motivation to continue their pursuit of knowledge.

To address this issue, I have created this repository. Here, we aim to curate research papers that are specifically relevant to our domain of interest.

My long-term vision for this repository is to build a central hub for a comprehensive collection of authentic research papers. Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced researcher, you should be able to find what you need right here.

Let's start by focusing on Brain Tumour Segmentation. As time goes on, we plan to expand our collection to cover various domains with the support of our community.

I have included a documentation in the Brain Tumour Segmentation folder that outlines the criteria for what I consider a good research paper. If you come across such a paper, please create a pull request, and if it meets our standards, we'll include it in this repository.

This initiative is brought to you by a student from Bharat ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, and I welcome all researchers to join this endeavor. Together, we can make research easier by gathering a treasure trove of valuable research papers.
